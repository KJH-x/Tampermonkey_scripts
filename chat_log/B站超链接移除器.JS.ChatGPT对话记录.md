# CHAT about JS

## CHAT ROUND 1

What do you know about Tampermonkey

Tampermonkey is a popular browser extension that allows users to customize and enhance their web browsing experience by running userscripts. Userscripts are small programs written in JavaScript that can modify the appearance or behavior of a website.

Tampermonkey supports a wide range of browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing userscripts and allows users to easily install, remove, and update them.

Userscripts can be created by anyone with programming knowledge and shared on user script repositories like Greasy Fork. These scripts can perform a wide range of tasks, such as adding new features to a website, removing annoying advertisements, or automating repetitive tasks.

Tampermonkey is often used by web developers and power users to streamline their browsing experience and customize websites to their liking. However, it's important to note that userscripts can also be used maliciously, so it's important to only install scripts from reputable sources and exercise caution when installing scripts from unknown authors.

## CHAT ROUND 2

Can you help  me write a tampermonkey script with some requirements?

Of course, I can help you write a Tampermonkey script. Please let me know what your requirements are, and I will do my best to assist you.

## CHAT ROUND 3

There is an `<a class="jump-link search-word">` in the target webpage (assuming the website is `target.website`) I want the script find all the `<a>` label with the specific class and replace the label with only the text it display. Ask me for more if my description is not clear.

Sure, here's a Tampermonkey script that should meet your requirements:

```JavaScript
// ==UserScript==
// @name         Remove Link Labels with Specific Class
// @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
// @version      1.0
// @description  Removes the label of <a> links with a specific class on the target website and replaces it with only the text it displays
// @author       Your Name
// @match        https://target.website/*
// @grant        none
// ==/UserScript==

(function() {
    'use strict';

    // Get all <a> elements with the class 'jump-link search-word'
    const links = document.querySelectorAll('a.jump-link.search-word');

    // Loop through each link
    links.forEach(link => {
        // Replace the link's label with only the text it displays
        link.textContent = link.innerText;
    });
})();
```

This script uses the `querySelectorAll` method to find all the `<a>` elements on the target website with the class "jump-link search-word". It then loops through each of these links and replaces the link's label with only the text it displays using the `textContent` property.

Note that this script will only work on the target website specified in the `@match` directive of the script header. If you want to use it on other websites, you will need to modify the `@match` directive accordingly.

## CHAT ROUND 4

print the log in the browser's console so that I can confirm its action

Sure, here's the updated script that prints a log message in the browser's console for each link it modifies:

```JavaScript
// ==UserScript==
// @name         Remove Link Labels with Specific Class
// @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
// @version      1.0
// @description  Removes the label of <a> links with a specific class on the target website and replaces it with only the text it displays, and logs the action in the console
// @author       Your Name
// @match        https://target.website/*
// @grant        none
// ==/UserScript==

(function() {
    'use strict';

    // Get all <a> elements with the class 'jump-link search-word'
    const links = document.querySelectorAll('a.jump-link.search-word');

    // Loop through each link
    links.forEach(link => {
        // Replace the link's label with only the text it displays
        link.textContent = link.innerText;

        // Log the action in the console
        console.log(`Removed label "${link.innerText}" from link:`, link);
    });
})();
```

This script is similar to the previous one, but it now logs a message in the console for each link it modifies using the `console.log` method. The log message includes the text of the link that was removed and a reference to the link object itself so you can inspect it further if needed.

## CHAT ROUND 5

It seems no log were printed(more likely not functioning). One possible cause might be that the webpage load the content including the target label after the main document loaded. Is it feasible to auto re-run the script when a new load is happening

Yes, it's possible that the script is not running because the target label is loaded dynamically after the main document has loaded. To handle this situation, you can use the `MutationObserver` API to observe changes to the DOM and re-run the script whenever the target label is added to the page.

Here's an updated version of the script that uses a `MutationObserver` to monitor the target website for changes to the DOM:

```JavaScript
// ==UserScript==
// @name         Remove Link Labels with Specific Class
// @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
// @version      2.0
// @description  Removes the label of <a> links with a specific class on the target website and replaces it with only the text it displays, and logs the action in the console, even if the label is loaded dynamically after the main document has loaded
// @author       Your Name
// @match        https://target.website/*
// @grant        none
// ==/UserScript==

(function() {
    'use strict';

    // Function to remove the label from a link
    function removeLinkLabel(link) {
        // Replace the link's label with only the text it displays
        link.textContent = link.innerText;

        // Log the action in the console
        console.log(`Removed label "${link.innerText}" from link:`, link);
    }

    // Function to handle mutations to the DOM
    function handleMutations(mutationsList) {
        // Loop through each mutation
        for (const mutation of mutationsList) {
            // Check if the mutation added a node with the class 'jump-link search-word'
            if (mutation.type === 'childList' && mutation.addedNodes.length) {
                const addedNodes = mutation.addedNodes;
                for (const node of addedNodes) {
                    if (node.nodeType === Node.ELEMENT_NODE && node.classList.contains('jump-link') && node.classList.contains('search-word')) {
                        // Remove the label from the new link
                        removeLinkLabel(node);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Get all <a> elements with the class 'jump-link search-word'
    const links = document.querySelectorAll('a.jump-link.search-word');

    // Loop through each link and remove the label
    links.forEach(removeLinkLabel);

    // Set up a MutationObserver to monitor changes to the DOM
    const observer = new MutationObserver(handleMutations);
    observer.observe(document.body, { childList: true, subtree: true });
})();
```

This script defines a `handleMutations` function that is called whenever the DOM is modified. The function loops through the mutations and checks if any added nodes have the class "jump-link search-word". If so, it calls the `removeLinkLabel` function to remove the label from the link.

The `removeLinkLabel` function is also defined in this script, and it's similar to the previous version of the script. It removes the label from the link and logs a message in the console.

The script also sets up a `MutationObserver` to monitor changes to the DOM. The observer is configured to watch for changes to the document body and all its descendants (i.e., the entire page), and it's set up to call the `handleMutations` function whenever a change is detected.

Note that this script should work even if the target label is loaded dynamically after the main document has loaded. However, keep in mind that using a `MutationObserver` can have a performance impact, so you should only use it when necessary.

## CHAT ROUND 6

Now the script is functioning better. Here are the further requirements. I want the log to be more compact, print only `Remove label {link.innerText}`, excluding the original label. It seems that the script isn't handling all the label matching the rules, may be a full re-search should be conduct when new content loading.

Sure, I can help you update the script with your new requirements.

To make the log more compact, we can modify the `removeLinkLabel` function to only log the text "Removed label" followed by the link text. Here's the updated function:

```JavaScript
function removeLinkLabel(link) {
    // Save the label for later logging
    const label = link.textContent;

    // Replace the link's label with only the text it displays
    link.textContent = link.innerText;

    // Log the action in the console
    console.log(`Removed label "${label}" from link`);
}
```

This function saves the link's original label in the `label` variable before removing it. Then, it logs a message in the console that only includes the text "Removed label" followed by the `label` variable.

To handle all the links that match the rules, including those that are loaded dynamically, we can modify the `handleMutations` function to re-run the `querySelectorAll` function to get all the links that match the rules. Here's the updated function:

```JavaScript
function handleMutations(mutationsList) {
    // Get all links with the class 'jump-link search-word'
    const links = document.querySelectorAll('a.jump-link.search-word');

    // Loop through each link and remove the label
    links.forEach(removeLinkLabel);

    // Loop through each mutation
    for (const mutation of mutationsList) {
        // Check if the mutation added a node with the class 'jump-link search-word'
        if (mutation.type === 'childList' && mutation.addedNodes.length) {
            const addedNodes = mutation.addedNodes;
            for (const node of addedNodes) {
                if (node.nodeType === Node.ELEMENT_NODE && node.classList.contains('jump-link') && node.classList.contains('search-word')) {
                    // Remove the label from the new link
                    removeLinkLabel(node);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This function starts by running `querySelectorAll` to get all the links that match the rules, and then loops through each link and removes the label.

Then, it loops through the mutations as before, and for any added nodes that match the rules, it calls the `removeLinkLabel` function.

Note that this script may have a performance impact if there are many links on the page or if the page is frequently modified. If you notice any performance issues, you may want to consider adding additional filtering or throttling logic to limit the number of times the script runs.

## CHAT ROUND 87

the target labels are always sub labels of `<div class="reply-list">`,narrow the search range using this rule. Also, I notice the webpage isn't be changed as expected though the log show it's functioning. maybe appending "_MODIFY:" to the front of the replacement text can debug this problem

Sure, I can help you update the script with your new requirements.

To limit the search range to only the links that are sub-labels of `<div class="reply-list">`, we can modify the `querySelectorAll` function to include that selector as well. Here's the updated code:

```JavaScript

const links = document.querySelectorAll('div.reply-list a.jump-link.search-word');
```

This will limit the search to only those links that are children of `<div class="reply-list">`.

To add the "_MODIFY:" prefix to the replacement text for debugging purposes, we can modify the `removeLinkLabel` function to prepend that prefix to the link's text content. Here's the updated code:

```JavaScript
function removeLinkLabel(link) {
    // Save the label for later logging
    const label = link.textContent;

    // Replace the link's label with only the text it displays
    link.textContent = `_MODIFY: ${link.innerText}`;

    // Log the action in the console
    console.log(`Removed label "${label}" from link`);
}
```

This will prepend the "_MODIFY:" prefix to the link's text content before logging the message in the console.

Regarding the issue where the webpage isn't being changed as expected, it's possible that there are other scripts or browser extensions running on the page that are interfering with the script. You may want to try disabling other extensions or scripts and see if that helps. It's also possible that the page's content is being dynamically generated after the script runs, in which case you may need to modify the script to wait for the content to finish loading before running.

## CHAT ROUND 8

Now come to the problem that the log show the script recursively replace the already-replace content. what should be the cause

The issue of the script recursively replacing the already-replaced content could be caused by a couple of things. One possibility is that the `removeLinkLabel` function is being called multiple times on the same link. To avoid this, we can add a check to see if the link's label has already been replaced before calling the function again.

Here's an updated version of the `removeLinkLabel` function with this check:

```JavaScript
function removeLinkLabel(link) {
  // Save the label for later logging
  const label = link.textContent;

  // Check if the label has already been removed
  if (!label.startsWith('_MODIFY: ')) {
    // Replace the link's label with only the text it displays
    link.textContent = `_MODIFY: ${link.innerText}`;

    // Log the action in the console
    console.log(`Removed label "${label}" from link`);
  }
}
```

This should prevent the script from replacing the label on the same link multiple times.

Another possibility is that the script is not properly detecting when new content has been loaded onto the page. If the page is dynamically generating new content after the initial load, the script may need to be modified to listen for changes to the page and re-run when new content is detected.

One way to do this is by using a mutation observer to detect changes to the page's DOM. Here's an example of how you can modify the script to use a mutation observer:

```JavaScript
// Define the mutation observer
const observer = new MutationObserver(function(mutationsList, observer) {
  // Call the script again when new content is detected
  removeLinkLabels();
});

// Start observing the page for changes
observer.observe(document.body, { childList: true, subtree: true });

// Define the function to remove the link labels
function removeLinkLabels() {
  // Find all the links that need their labels removed
  const links = document.querySelectorAll('div.reply-list a.jump-link.search-word');

  // Loop through the links and remove their labels
  for (const link of links) {
    removeLinkLabel(link);
  }
}

// Call the function to remove the link labels initially
removeLinkLabels();
```

This script uses a mutation observer to listen for changes to the page's DOM. When new content is detected, the `removeLinkLabels` function is called again to remove the labels from the new links.

I hope this helps!

## CHAT ROUND 9

The first method works! I notice the target text on the web page is now replaced with `_MODIFY:`, but it's still in `<a>` label.  I want to replace the hyperlink label with its raw text.

Glad to hear the first method works for you!

To replace the hyperlink label with its raw text, we can modify the `removeLinkLabel` function to first get the link's text content, then replace the link element with a new text node containing that text content. Here's an updated version of the function:

```JavaScript
function removeLinkLabel(link) {
  // Save the label for later logging
  const label = link.textContent;

  // Check if the label has already been removed
  if (!label.startsWith('_MODIFY: ')) {
    // Replace the link element with a new text node containing the link's text content
    const textNode = document.createTextNode(link.textContent);
    link.parentNode.replaceChild(textNode, link);

    // Log the action in the console
    console.log(`Removed label "${label}" from link`);
  }
}
```

This should replace the hyperlink label with its raw text, while still logging the action to the console.

I hope this helps!

## CHAT ROUND 10

Yes, this version perfectly met my expection! I want the script furtherly delete the label `<i>` with `<class="icon search-word">`, which emerge right after the label `<a>` we have just handled

Glad to hear that the script is now meeting your expectations!

To delete the `i` element with class `icon search-word` that appears right after the `a` element, we can modify the `removeLinkLabel` function to first find the `i` element using `link.nextElementSibling`, and then remove it if it has the class we're looking for. Here's an updated version of the function:

```JavaScript
function removeLinkLabel(link) {
  // Save the label for later logging
  const label = link.textContent;

  // Check if the label has already been removed
  if (!label.startsWith('_MODIFY: ')) {
    // Replace the link element with a new text node containing the link's text content
    const textNode = document.createTextNode(link.textContent);
    link.parentNode.replaceChild(textNode, link);

    // Log the action in the console
    console.log(`Removed label "${label}" from link`);

    // Remove the next i element if it has class "icon search-word"
    const icon = link.nextElementSibling;
    if (icon && icon.classList.contains('icon') && icon.classList.contains('search-word')) {
      icon.remove();
      console.log(`Removed icon with class "icon search-word"`);
    }
  }
}
```

This should remove the `i` element with class `icon search-word` that appears right after the `a` element, while still logging the action to the console.

I hope this helps!

## CHAT ROUND 11

No, this new version didn't successfully delete the `<i>` label. I suggest you undo the last change and write a new function to handle it individually(which should also log in console with words:`Removed a search icon`)

I apologize for the previous version not working as expected.

To remove the `i` element with class `icon search-word` that appears right after the `a` element, we can write a separate function that will take care of this. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```JavaScript
function removeSearchIcon(link) {
  const icon = link.nextElementSibling;
  if (icon && icon.classList.contains('icon') && icon.classList.contains('search-word')) {
    icon.remove();
    console.log(`Removed search icon`);
  }
}
```

Then, in the `main` function, we can call this new function after `removeLinkLabel` to remove the search icon. Here's an updated version of the `main` function that includes the `removeSearchIcon` function call:

```JavaScript
function main() {
  const replyList = document.querySelector('.reply-list');
  if (replyList) {
    const links = replyList.querySelectorAll('a.search-word');
    links.forEach(link => {
      removeLinkLabel(link);
      removeSearchIcon(link);
    });
  }
}

// Run the script when the DOM is ready
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', main);
```

This should remove the `i` element with class `icon search-word` that appears right after the `a` element, while still logging the action to the console.

I hope this helps!

## CHAT ROUND 12

I notice that the removeSearchIcon still not functioning, maybe we can remove the limit that it only emerge after label `<a>`

I apologize for the confusion. If the `i` element with class `icon search-word` can appear in places other than directly after the `a` element, we can modify the `removeSearchIcon` function to handle this case as well.

Here's an updated version of the `removeSearchIcon` function that should remove any `i` element with class `icon search-word` within the same parent as the provided `link` element:

```JavaScript
function removeSearchIcon(link) {
  const parent = link.parentElement;
  const searchIcon = parent.querySelector('i.icon.search-word');
  if (searchIcon) {
    searchIcon.remove();
    console.log(`Removed search icon`);
  }
}
```

Then, in the `main` function, we can call this updated `removeSearchIcon` function after `removeLinkLabel` to remove the search icon. Here's an updated version of the `main` function:

```JavaScript
function main() {
  const replyList = document.querySelector('.reply-list');
  if (replyList) {
    const links = replyList.querySelectorAll('a.search-word');
    links.forEach(link => {
      removeLinkLabel(link);
      removeSearchIcon(link);
    });
  }
}

// Run the script when the DOM is ready
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', main);
```

This should remove any `i` element with class `icon search-word` that appears within the same parent as the `a` element, while still logging the action to the console.

## CHAT ROUND 13

No, this still not look good, why not search the `<i class="icon search-word">` individually, not relying on the matched `<a class='jump-link search-word'>` label. I think the present matching rule miss the matching `<i>`

I apologize for the confusion. You're right that the current implementation of `removeSearchIcon` relies on the `i` element being within the same parent as the `a` element, which may not always be the case. We can modify the function to search for any `i` element with class `icon search-word` and remove it.

Here's an updated version of the `removeSearchIcon` function that should work more reliably:

```JavaScript
function removeSearchIcon(link) {
  const searchIcons = document.querySelectorAll('i.icon.search-word');
  searchIcons.forEach(searchIcon => {
    if (searchIcon.parentElement === link.parentElement) {
      searchIcon.remove();
      console.log(`Removed search icon`);
    }
  });
}
```

Then, in the `main` function, we can call this updated `removeSearchIcon` function after `removeLinkLabel` to remove the search icon. Here's an updated version of the `main` function:

```JavaScript
function main() {
  const replyList = document.querySelector('.reply-list');
  if (replyList) {
    const links = replyList.querySelectorAll('a.search-word');
    links.forEach(link => {
      removeLinkLabel(link);
      removeSearchIcon(link);
    });
  }
}

// Run the script when the DOM is ready
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', main);
```

This should remove any `i` element with class `icon search-word` that appears within the same parent as the `a` element, while still logging the action to the console.

## CHAT ROUND 14

Maybe we have misunderstand, here's script I'm testing, check if i have done it wrong:

```Javascript

        // Save the label for later logging
        const label = link.textContent;
        // Replace the link element with a new text node containing the link's text content        
        const textNode = document.createTextNode(link.textContent);
        link.parentNode.replaceChild(textNode, link);
        // Log the action in the console
        console.log(`Removed label "${label}" from link`);
    }
    function removeSearchIcon(link) {
        const searchIcons = document.querySelectorAll('i.icon.search-word');
        searchIcons.forEach(searchIcon => {
            if (searchIcon.parentElement === link.parentElement) {
                searchIcon.remove();

            }
        });
    }
    // Function to handle mutations to the DOM
    function handleMutations(mutationsList) {
        // Get all links with the class 'jump-link search-word'
        const links = document.querySelectorAll('a.jump-link.search-word');
        // Loop through each link and remove the label
        links.forEach(removeLinkLabel);
        // Loop through each mutation
        for (const mutation of mutationsList) {
            // Check if the mutation added a node with the class 'jump-link search-word'
            if (mutation.type === 'childList' && mutation.addedNodes.length) {
                const addedNodes = mutation.addedNodes;
                for (const node of addedNodes) {
                    if (node.nodeType === Node.ELEMENT_NODE && node.classList.contains('jump-link') && node.classList.contains('search-word')) {
                        // Remove the label from the new
                        removeLinkLabel(node);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    // Get all <a> elements with the class 'jump-link search-word'
    const links = document.querySelectorAll('div.reply-list a.jump-link.search-word');
    // Loop through each link and remove the label
    links.forEach(removeLinkLabel);
    // Set up a MutationObserver to monitor changes to the DOM
    const observer = new MutationObserver(handleMutations);
    observer.observe(document.body, { childList: true, subtree: true });
    function main() {
        const replyList = document.querySelector('.reply-list');
        if (replyList) {
            const links = replyList.querySelectorAll('a.search-word');
            links.forEach(link => { removeLinkLabel(link); removeSearchIcon(link); });
        }
    }
    // Run the script when the DOM is ready
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', main);
})();

The updated script you provided looks good. It should remove the label of `<a>` links with a specific class and replace it with only the text it displays, as well as remove the `<i>` label with class "icon search-word" that comes after the link.

Please note that since this is a userscript, it may not work properly on all browsers and may require the Tampermonkey extension to be installed. Also, please make sure to respect the website's terms of use and do not use this script for any malicious purposes.

I found the `<i class="icon search-word">` not just occur after the `<a class='jump-link search-word'>`, what should i do to improve

In that case, you can search for all occurrences of the `<i class="icon search-word">` elements on the page and remove them individually. Here's an updated version of the `removeSearchIcon()` function that does this:

```JavaScript
function removeSearchIcon(link) {
    const searchIcons = document.querySelectorAll('i.icon.search-word');
    searchIcons.forEach(searchIcon => {
        if (searchIcon.parentElement === link.parentElement) {
            searchIcon.remove();
            console.log(`Removed search icon`);
        }
    });
}
```

This function will remove all `<i class="icon search-word">` elements that are siblings of the link's parent element.

## CHAT ROUND 16

Should i update the function main to work with this change?

Yes, you need to update the `main` function to work with this change.

Instead of just removing the `search-word` class, you can check for the presence of the `icon search-word` class and remove it along with the label. Here's an updated version of the `main` function that should work:

```JavaScript
function main() {
    const replyList = document.querySelector('.reply-list');
    if (replyList) {
        const links = replyList.querySelectorAll('a.jump-link.search-word');
        links.forEach(link => {
            if (link.querySelector('i.icon.search-word')) {
                removeSearchIcon(link);
            }
            removeLinkLabel(link);
        });
    }
}
```

This version will first check if the link has a child element with the class `icon search-word`. If it does, it will call the `removeSearchIcon` function to remove the icon. Then it will call the `removeLinkLabel` function to remove the label from the link.

## CHAT ROUND 17

I found `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'replaceChild')` in the console, should we do something to catch the error?

Yes, we can add a try-catch block around the line of code that throws the error to catch the error and log it to the console with an appropriate error message. Here is an updated `removeLinkLabel` function with error handling:

```JavaScript
function removeLinkLabel(link) {
    // Save the label for later logging
    const label = link.textContent;
    try {
        // Replace the link element with a new text node containing the link's text content
        const textNode = document.createTextNode(link.textContent);
        link.parentNode.replaceChild(textNode, link);

        // Log the action in the console
        console.log(`Removed label "${label}" from link`);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(`Error removing label "${label}" from link: ${err}`);
    }
}
```

This will catch any errors that occur while trying to remove the label and log them to the console with an error message.

## CHAT ROUND 18

modify the funtion `removeSearchIcon` to search and replace all matching occurance in the range of the whole webpage.

Sure, you can modify the `removeSearchIcon` function to search and replace all matching occurrences in the whole webpage as follows:

```JavaScript
function removeSearchIcon() {
  const searchIcons = document.querySelectorAll('i.icon.search-word');
  searchIcons.forEach(searchIcon => {
    // Check if the parent element is a link with the class 'jump-link search-word'
    const parentLink = searchIcon.closest('a.jump-link.search-word');
    if (parentLink) {
      // Remove the search icon
      searchIcon.remove();
      console.log(`Removed search icon from link "${parentLink.textContent}"`);
    }
  });
}
```

This function uses `querySelectorAll` to get all matching search icon elements on the webpage, and then loops through each icon and checks if its parent element is a link with the class `jump-link search-word`. If it is, the function removes the search icon from the parent element and logs the action in the console. Finally, you can call this function in the `main` function to remove all search icons in the webpage.

## CHAT ROUND 19

how should i update the function main

You can update the `main` function to call `removeSearchIcon` for all search icons on the webpage instead of just those within the `.reply-list` element. Here's an updated version of the `main` function:

```JavaScript
function main() {
    const links = document.querySelectorAll('a.search-word');
    links.forEach(link => {
        removeLinkLabel(link);
        removeSearchIcon(link);
    });
}
```

This will remove the label and the search icon from all links on the webpage with the `search-word` class.

## CHAT ROUND 20

In function `removeLinkLabel` catch err but not log(ignore it)

Sure, you can modify the `removeLinkLabel` function to catch and ignore the error like this:

```JavaScript
function removeLinkLabel(link) {
    try {
        // Save the label for later logging
        const label = link.textContent;
        // Replace the link element with a new text node containing the link's text content
        const textNode = document.createTextNode(link.textContent);
        link.parentNode.replaceChild(textNode, link);

        // Log the action in the console
        console.log(`Removed label "${label}" from link`);
    } catch (err) {
        // ignore the error
    }
}
```

This way, if there is an error during the replacement, it will be caught and ignored, and the script will continue to run without logging the error.

## CHAT ROUND 21

May be there is some problem not so obvious. I can define and use `removeSearchIcon` in console and it will work as expected, however it's not functioning in the script

It's possible that there's an issue with the timing of when the `removeSearchIcon` function is called in the script. If it's called before the elements it's searching for are loaded onto the page, then it won't be able to find them.

One way to fix this would be to wait until the DOM has fully loaded before running the script. You can do this by wrapping your code in an event listener for the `DOMContentLoaded` event, like this:

```JavaScript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // your code here
});
```

Alternatively, you can wait until all resources have finished loading before running the script, by using the `load` event instead:

```JavaScript
window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    // your code here
});
```

By waiting for the page to fully load before running your script, you can ensure that all the elements you're searching for are present on the page and can be found by your functions.
